# tbapy [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tbapy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tbapy)
_1418 TBA Libraries_ // [**Python**](https://github.com/frc1418/tbapy) // [Go](https://github.com/frc1418/tbago) // [Ruby](https://github.com/frc1418/tbarb)

> Python library for interfacing with [The Blue Alliance](https://thebluealliance.com) [API](https://thebluealliance.com/apidocs) (v3).

## Setup
First, install the module:

    pip3 install tbapy

Then, to use these functions, you must import the `tbapy` module:

```py
import tbapy
```

Before using the library, you must instantiate its class, for example:

```py
tba = tbapy.TBA('key')
```

The Blue Alliance's API requires that all applications identify themselves with an auth key when retrieving data. To obtain an auth key, visit TBA's [Account page](https://www.thebluealliance.com/account).


## Retrieval Functions
You may specify `simple=True` to get only vital data on some models or lists of models, or you may specify `keys=True` to get a list of the keys for a list rather than full data on each model. It is recommended to use these options if you do not need full data.

Some requests support `year` and other optional parameters, which are recommended to use to narrow down your results.
* `tba.status()` - Get TBA's status.
* `tba.teams([page], [year], [simple/keys])` - Get a list of of valid teams, where `page * 500` is the starting team number. If no page is provided, all teams will be fetched.
* `tba.team(team, [simple])` - Get a team's data. `team` can be an integer team number of a string-form `'frc####'` identifier.
* `tba.team_events(team, [year], [simple/keys])` - Get a list of events a team has been to.
* `tba.team_awards(team, [event/year])` - Get a list of the team's awards.
* `tba.team_matches(team, [event/year], [simple/keys])` - Get a list of a team's matches at an event.
* `tba.team_years(team)` - Get a list of years the team was active in FRC.
* `tba.team_media(team, [year], [tag])` - Get team media. Specify a year to get media from or a tag or both.
* `tba.team_robots(team)` - Get data about a team's robots.
* `tba.team_districts(team)` - Get the districts that a team has been part of over the years.
* `tba.team_profiles(team)` - Get data on a team's media profiles.
* `tba.team_status(team, event)` - Get a team's status at an event.
* `tba.events([year], [simple/keys])` - Get a list of all events.
* `tba.event(event, [simple])` - Get data about an event.
* `tba.event_rankings(event)` - Gets a list of team rankings at a given event.
* `tba.event_alliances(event)` - Get sophisticated data on alliances at a given event.
* `tba.event_district_points(event)` - Get sophisticated data on district points at a given event.
* `tba.event_insights(event)` - Get insight data on a given event.
* `tba.event_oprs(event)` - Get sophisticated data on alliances at a given event.
* `tba.event_predictions(event)` - Get predicted scores for a given event.
* `tba.event_teams(event, [simple/keys])` - Get a list of teams at an event.
* `tba.event_awards(event)` - Get the awards from an event.
* `tba.event_matches(event, [simple/keys])` - Get a match list of an event.
* `tba.match([key], [year], [event], [type], [number], [round], [simple])` - Get data about a match. You may either pass the match's `key` directly, or pass `year`, `event`, `type`, `match` (the match number), and `round` if applicable (playoffs only). The event year may be specified as part of the event key or specified in the `year` parameter.
* `tba.districts(year)` - Get a list of all districts that exist(ed) in a given year.
* `tba.district_events(district, [simple/keys])` - Get list of events in a district.
* `tba.district_rankings(district)` - Get the rankings in a district.
* `tba.district_teams(district, [simple/keys])` - Get a list of the teams in a district.
* `tba.district_history(abbreviation)` - Get a list of districts associated with the given abbreviation (e.g. `'fim'`).
* `tba.district_awards(district)` - Get a list of awards in a district.
* `tba.insights_leaderboards(year)` - Get a list of leaderboard insights in the given year. Use year=0 for overall.
* `tba.insights_notables(year)` - Get a list of notable insights in the given year. Use year=0 for overall.


See `example.py` for several usage examples.

Documentation for The Blue Alliance's API can be found [here](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs).

## Write Functions
Writing to The Blue Alliance requires an additional set of tokens that can be obtained [here](https://www.thebluealliance.com/request/apiwrite).

Since each set of tokens is unique to an event you will have the instantiate the TBA class like so:
```
tba = tbapy.TBA('key', 'ID', 'secret', 'event_key')
```
or update an existing TBA object like so:
```
tba.update_trusted('ID', 'secret', 'event_key')
```
All of the write functions require data models that can be found [here at the Write API documentation](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs/trusted/v1)
* `tba.update_event_info(info)` - Update the Event's info with the given dictionary.
* `tba.update_event_alliances(alliances)` - Update the alliances. Input is a list of lists, 8 lists with the team names in frc#### format are expected.
* `tba.update_event_awards(awards)` - Update the awards for an event with a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary must have a name_str key and optionally a team_key key in frc### format and/or an awardee key for an individual award.
* `tba.update_event_matches(rankings)` - Update the matches of an event with a dictionary. Additional info can be found in the Write API Documentation on The Blue Alliance.
* `tba.delete_event_matches([matches])` - Delete all matches or the matches in the given list.
* `tba.update_event_rankings(rankings)` - Update rankings of an event with a dictionary containing a breakdowns key and rankings key. Rankings key must have a list of dictionaries as the value.
* `tba.update_event_team_list(team_list)` - Replace the event's team list with the list given.
* `tba.add_match_videos(match_videos)` - Add YouTube videos to matches with a dictionary of partial match keys to YouTube video ids.
* `tba.add_event_videos(event_videos)` - Add videos to the event's media tab on The Blue Alliance with a list of YouTube video ids.
